# AI Development Standards

🚀 **Shared development standards, architecture patterns, and best practices for AI-human collaborative development**

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as our living playbook for building production-ready applications through AI-human collaboration. It ensures every project starts with proper architecture, security, and scalability from day one.

## 📋 Quick Start

Before starting any new AI development project:

1. **Review** → [Architecture Requirements](./architecture/requirements.md)
2. **Choose** → [Project Template](./templates/)  
3. **Follow** → [Pre-Development Checklist](./checklists/pre-development.md)
4. **Build** → With safety and modularity built-in
5. **Review** → [Code Review Checklist](./checklists/code-review.md)
6. **Secure** → [Security Guidelines](./docs/security.md)

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Every project follows these core principles:**
- **Modular design** with single responsibility
- **Clear separation** of concerns (data/business/presentation)
- **Configuration-driven** development
- **MCP-friendly** file structure
- **Production-ready** error handling
- **Safety-first** development practices

```

## 🛡️ Security & Quality First

We prioritize safety and quality in every project:
- **Branch-based development** (never commit directly to main)
- **Security validation** for all dependencies
- **Input validation and sanitization** by default
- **Documentation and testing** for all modules
- **Production-ready error handling** from day one

## 🚀 Available Templates

Choose your project type:
- **[Node.js API](./templates/node-api/)** - Backend services and APIs
- **React App** *(coming soon)* - Frontend applications  
- **Full-Stack** *(coming soon)* - Complete web applications
