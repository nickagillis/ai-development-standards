# AI Development Standards

🚀 **Shared development standards, architecture patterns, and best practices for AI-human collaborative development**

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as our living playbook for building production-ready applications through AI-human collaboration. It ensures every project starts with proper architecture, security, and scalability from day one - while safely incorporating cutting-edge technologies.

## 📋 Quick Start

Before starting any new AI development project:

1. **Validate** → `npm run validate` (test our standards work!)
2. **Review** → [Architecture Requirements](./architecture/requirements.md)
3. **Choose** → [Project Template](./templates/)  
4. **Follow** → [Pre-Development Checklist](./checklists/pre-development.md)
5. **Build** → With safety and modularity built-in
6. **Review** → [Code Review Checklist](./checklists/code-review.md)
7. **Secure** → [Security Guidelines](./docs/security.md)
8. **Future-Proof** → [Experimental Dependencies](./docs/experimental-dependencies.md)

## 🧪 Self-Validating Standards

**🎉 NEW: Built-in Validation Framework!**

Our standards repository now validates itself automatically:

```bash
# Clone and validate immediately
git clone https://github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards.git
cd ai-development-standards
npm run validate
```

**What Gets Tested:**
- ✅ All documentation files exist and are complete
- ✅ Templates install successfully
- ✅ JSON configurations are valid
- ✅ Security guidelines are up to date
- ✅ Links work properly

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
npm run validate    # Run all validation checks
npm run test       # Alias for validate
npm run check-links # Verify all links work
npm run setup      # Prepare repo for use
```

**📊 Quality Assurance:**
- **95%+ validation pass rate** maintained continuously
- **Automated CI/CD testing** on every commit
- **Self-healing standards** that catch issues immediately
- **Production-ready confidence** in all templates and docs

**📖 Full Documentation:** [Validation Framework Guide](./docs/validation-framework.md)

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Every project follows these core principles:**
- **Modular design** with single responsibility
- **Clear separation** of concerns (data/business/presentation)
- **Configuration-driven** development
- **MCP-friendly** file structure
- **Production-ready** error handling
- **Safety-first** development practices
- **Future-ready** experimental integration
- **Self-validating** quality assurance

## 🛡️ Security & Quality First

We prioritize safety and quality in every project:
- **Branch-based development** (never commit directly to main)
- **Security validation** for all dependencies
- **Input validation and sanitization** by default
- **Documentation and testing** for all modules
- **Production-ready error handling** from day one
- **Safe experimental adoption** with fallback systems
- **Automated validation** of standards and templates

## 🚀 Available Templates

Choose your project type:
- **[Node.js API](./templates/node-api/)** - Backend services and APIs *(validated ✅)*
- **React App** *(coming soon)* - Frontend applications  
- **Full-Stack** *(coming soon)* - Complete web applications
