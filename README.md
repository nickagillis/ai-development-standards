## üöÄ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### **1. Setup & Integration**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards.git
cd ai-development-standards
npm install

# Integrate with Claude Desktop
./scripts/claude-integration.sh setup
```

### **2. Validate System Health**
```bash
npm run test:unit                      # Unit tests (7/7 should pass)
npm run test:integration               # Integration tests with real APIs
npm run test:auto-healing              # Auto-healing workflow validation
npm run pre-merge-validation           # Standards compliance check
```

### **3. Start Your Project**
```bash
# Choose your template
cp -r templates/react-app/ my-react-project/       # Modern React + TypeScript
cp -r templates/python-cli/ my-cli-tool/           # Rich Python CLI
cp -r templates/mcp-service/ my-service/           # Claude-optimized service
cp -r templates/micro-module/ my-module/           # Basic modular component
```

### **4. Use with Claude**
```
Claude, I'm starting a new project using the AI Development Standards from 
github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards. Please help me:

1. Initialize a [React App/Python CLI/MCP Service] following context optimization
2. Set up the modular architecture with file size limits
3. Run through the pre-development checklist
4. Ensure all components follow the standards
5. Set up auto-healing compliance for my repository

Project: [YOUR PROJECT NAME]
```

## üé≠ We Practice What We Preach

**Transparency**: This repository follows its own auto-healing standards. We openly document our compliance journey, including the 7 violations we made while building the compliance system - proving why automation is essential!

**Current Self-Compliance**: ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress (working to eliminate our own violations)
