# AI Development Standards

🚀 **Shared development standards, architecture patterns, and best practices for AI-human collaborative development**

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as our living playbook for building production-ready applications through AI-human collaboration. It ensures every project starts with proper architecture, security, and scalability from day one.

## 📋 Quick Start

Before starting any new AI development project:

1. **Review** → [Architecture Requirements](./architecture/requirements.md)
2. **Choose** → [Project Template](./templates/)  
3. **Follow** → [Pre-Development Checklist](./checklists/pre-development.md)
4. **Build** → With safety and modularity built-in
5. **Review** → [Code Review Checklist](./checklists/code-review.md)

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Every project follows these core principles:**
- **Modular design** with single responsibility
- **Clear separation** of concerns (data/business/presentation)
- **Configuration-driven** development
- **MCP-friendly** file structure
- **Production-ready** error handling
- **Safety-first** development practices

## 🌟 Success Stories

- **[AI Inventory Advisor](https://github.com/nickagillis/ai-inventory-advisor)** - Automotive dealership inventory management AI

## 🚀 Getting Started

Choose your project type:
- **[Node.js API](./templates/node-api/)** - Backend services and APIs
- **[React App](./templates/react-app/)** - Frontend applications  
- **[Full-Stack](./templates/full-stack/)** - Complete web applications

## 🛡️ Safety & Quality

We prioritize safety and quality in every project:
- Branch-based development (never commit directly to main)
- Security validation for all dependencies
- Input validation and sanitization by default
- Documentation and testing for all modules
