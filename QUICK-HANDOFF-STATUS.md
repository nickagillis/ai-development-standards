## 🧠 **COMMUNITY WISDOM ENGINE STATUS**

### **Successfully Logged Patterns**
- ✅ **Problem Pattern**: `circular-dependency` → `lazy-loading` solution
- ✅ **Standards Pattern**: `standards-conflation` → `clear-separation` (handoff vs auto-healing)
- ✅ **Process Pattern**: `real-time-handoff-updates` → `session-continuity`
- ✅ **Meta Pattern**: `practice-while-creating` → `standards-validation`

### **Latest Process Innovation**
