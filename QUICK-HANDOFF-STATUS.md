## 📋 **TODO LIST: PRIORITIZED OPPORTUNITIES (POST-MERGE UPDATE)**

### **🚨 HIGH PRIORITY (Post-Merge Actions)**
- [ ] **TEST NEW HANDOFF STANDARDS** - Validate handoff effectiveness in next AI collaboration session
- [ ] **UPDATE AUTO-HEALING-STANDARDS.md** - Remove conflated handoff requirements (cleanup task)
- [ ] **UPDATE README.md** - Reference new HANDOFF-STANDARDS.md in main documentation
- [ ] **LOG SUCCESS STORY** - Document handoff standards implementation in Community Wisdom Engine

### **⚡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (System Enhancement)**
- [ ] **Test auto-healing commons integration** - Integrate existing scripts with `scripts/auto-healing-commons.sh`
- [ ] **Enable repository branch protection** - Practice what we preach with GitHub settings
- [ ] **Apply lazy loading pattern** to other modules (check `src/ai-intelligence/`, `src/mcp/`, `src/workspace-monitoring/`)
- [ ] **Enhance MCP integration monitoring** with auto-healing compliance validation

### **💡 LOW PRIORITY (Advanced Features)**
- [ ] **Pattern-based recommendations** - Analyze failure patterns to suggest preventive measures
- [ ] **Automatic issue creation** for recurring problems
- [ ] **Smart handoff prioritization** - Highlight most critical next steps
- [ ] **Cross-repository auto-healing** - Apply learnings to other projects
