## 📋 **TODO LIST: PRIORITIZED OPPORTUNITIES (UPDATED)**

### **🚨 HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Standards Completion)**
- [ ] **COMPLETE HANDOFF STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION** - Update AI-COLLABORATION-WORKFLOW-CHECKLIST.md with handoff requirements
- [ ] **MERGE HANDOFF-STANDARDS.md** - Complete the PR and get handoff standards on main branch
- [ ] **UPDATE AUTO-HEALING-STANDARDS.md** - Remove conflated handoff requirements, keep only long-term learning
- [ ] **TEST HANDOFF STANDARDS** - Validate that new handoff approach works for session continuity

### **⚡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (System Enhancement)**
- [ ] **Test auto-healing commons integration** - Integrate existing scripts with `scripts/auto-healing-commons.sh`
- [ ] **Enable repository branch protection** - Practice what we preach with GitHub settings
- [ ] **Apply lazy loading pattern** to other modules (check `src/ai-intelligence/`, `src/mcp/`, `src/workspace-monitoring/`)
- [ ] **Enhance MCP integration monitoring** with auto-healing compliance validation

### **💡 LOW PRIORITY (Advanced Features)**
- [ ] **Pattern-based recommendations** - Analyze failure patterns to suggest preventive measures
- [ ] **Automatic issue creation** for recurring problems
- [ ] **Smart handoff prioritization** - Highlight most critical next steps
- [ ] **Cross-repository auto-healing** - Apply learnings to other projects

## 📁 **WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED (UPDATED)**

### **Current Session Achievements (June 30, 2025 - Handoff Standards Clarification)**
- ✅ **Handoff vs Auto-Healing distinction clarified** - Identified conflation in existing standards
- ✅ **HANDOFF-STANDARDS.md created** - Dedicated standards document for session continuity (separate from long-term learning)
- ✅ **Handoff workflow defined** - Clear requirements for during-session updates and validation
- ✅ **Standards gap identified** - Previous documentation mixed immediate continuity with long-term learning
- ✅ **Branch created** - `feature/handoff-standards-clarification` for safety-first development
- ✅ **Practicing standards** - Updating handoff documents in real-time during this session

### **Previous Session Achievements (Verification Session)**
- ✅ **System verification complete** - All infrastructure confirmed operational on main branch
- ✅ **Test validation successful** - Unit tests (4/4), integration tests (7/7), security tests all pass
- ✅ **Performance confirmation** - 50%+ startup improvement validated through actual testing
- ✅ **Success documentation confirmed** - Issue #14 comprehensively captures breakthroughs
- ✅ **Repository status validated** - Main branch has ALL updated standards (v1.9.1)

### **Core Technical Achievements (Previous Sessions)**
- ✅ **Circular dependency eliminated** - System initializes cleanly with lazy loading
- ✅ **Security enhanced** - Automatic password/token redaction
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - 50%+ faster startup time
- ✅ **Error handling robust** - Works even when config fails

### **Auto-Healing Infrastructure (COMPLETE)**
- ✅ **Auto-healing commons script** - Core automation functions (`scripts/auto-healing-commons.sh`)
- ✅ **Auto-healing standards document** - Mandatory automation requirements (`docs/AUTO-HEALING-STANDARDS.md`)
- ✅ **Auto-healing test integration** - Complete workflow validation (`scripts/test-auto-healing-integration.sh`)
- ✅ **GitHub Actions workflows** - Automated compliance checking (`.github/workflows/auto-healing-compliance.yml`)
- ✅ **Community Wisdom logging** - Session data flows automatically to knowledge base
- ✅ **Compliance validation** - Automatic standards adherence checking

## 🧠 **COMMUNITY WISDOM ENGINE STATUS**

### **Successfully Logged**
- ✅ **Problem Pattern**: `circular-dependency` → `lazy-loading` solution
- ✅ **Success Indicators**: `no-blocking-initialization`, `fallback-mechanisms`, `security-features`
- ✅ **NEW Pattern**: `standards-conflation` → `clear-separation` (handoff vs auto-healing)
- ✅ **Process Pattern**: `real-time-handoff-updates` → `session-continuity`

### **Latest Process Improvement**
- ✅ **Critical discovery**: Handoff and auto-healing requirements were conflated
- ✅ **Standards clarity**: Created dedicated handoff standards separate from long-term learning
- ✅ **Practice validation**: Demonstrating real-time handoff updates during standards creation
- ✅ **Process improvement**: Clear workflow for during-session handoff maintenance
