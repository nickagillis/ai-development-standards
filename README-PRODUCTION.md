## FAQ

### Q: How does this prevent duplicate work?
**A:** Advanced similarity algorithms analyze titles, descriptions, branch names, and keywords to detect potential duplicates before you start coding. 85%+ accuracy rate.

### Q: Is my code secure?
**A:** Absolutely. The system only analyzes metadata (titles, descriptions, file names) - never actual source code. All data is validated and sanitized.

### Q: What if MCP/GitHub is unavailable?
**A:** Graceful fallback systems provide local analysis and recommendations. You're never blocked from developing.

### Q: Can it analyze multiple repositories?
**A:** Yes! Enterprise features include cross-repository duplicate detection and organization-wide coordination.

### Q: How much does it cost?
**A:** The core system is open source and free. Only GitHub API usage (which you likely already have) is required.
