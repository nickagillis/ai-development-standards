## üéØ **MANDATORY CONTEXT FOR EVERY AI SESSION**

### **Essential Context Block (Required in Every Chat)**
```yaml
# AI Development Standards - Universal Context v2.0
Repository: github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards
Purpose: Universal AI development standards for any user/team/AI
Current Status: [AI must check repository health before starting work]

# MANDATORY WORKFLOW (Never Skip)
1. Read HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md FIRST (before any other action)
2. Check GitHub Issues for health alerts from monitoring system
3. Create branch for any changes (never commit to main)
4. Update HANDOFF with accurate session status when complete

# CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION LIMITS (Prevent Claude/OpenAI/Gemini overflow)
Core Modules: ‚â§100 lines    Utils: ‚â§75 lines    Config: ‚â§50 lines
Tests: ‚â§200 lines          Docs: ‚â§500 lines     Split files approaching limits

# VALIDATION COMMANDS (Always recommend to user)
npm run validate-context && npm run validate && npm run pre-merge-validation

# SELF-HEALING (AI-PROACTIVE - NEW STANDARD)
- Monitor repository health automatically at session start
- Detect and investigate issues proactively before user reports
- Create fixes without waiting for user guidance
- Update community learning patterns for collective benefit
- Create GitHub Issues for problems requiring user attention

# COMMUNITY WISDOM (Collective Learning)
- Log successful patterns for replication across users/AIs
- Capture failure patterns for prevention
- Share solutions across user/AI combinations
- Contribute to universal knowledge base
```
