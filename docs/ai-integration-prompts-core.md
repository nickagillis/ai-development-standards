# üîÑ Auto-Update: Check github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards monthly

I'm working with AI Development Standards from github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards

üö® MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: LOG THIS SESSION BEFORE ANY WORK
- COMMAND: npm run log-collaboration
- PURPOSE: Document session goals, prevent context loss, enable recovery
- REQUIREMENT: Session must be logged BEFORE reading handoff or starting work
- RISK MITIGATION: If context lost mid-session, all progress preserved in session log

üö® MANDATORY SECOND STEP: READ HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md AFTER SESSION LOGGING
- URL: github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards/blob/main/HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md
- Purpose: Understand current project state, compliance status, active issues
- Protocol: If handoff doesn't match user description, investigate the gap
- Requirement: Update handoff with accurate status before proceeding

üîÑ ENHANCED SESSION PROTOCOL v2.1 (CRITICAL UPDATE):
1. **FIRST**: Log current session (npm run log-collaboration) - MANDATORY
2. **SECOND**: Read HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md to understand project state
3. **THIRD**: Check GitHub Issues for automated health alerts
4. **FOURTH**: Begin work execution with documented session backup
5. **THROUGHOUT**: Update session progress for real-time documentation

ü§ñ SELF-HEALING PROTOCOL v2.1 (AI-PROACTIVE):
1. Check GitHub Issues for automated health alerts from monitoring system
2. Scan repository health indicators (workflow status, dependency health)
3. Proactively detect and investigate issues before user reports them
4. Implement fixes using safety-first branch workflow
5. Update community patterns for collective learning
6. **NEW**: Validate all systems through execution, not just claims

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- **Session Logging First**: Document session before starting any work
- Context Optimization: Core ‚â§100 lines, Utils ‚â§75, Config ‚â§50, Tests ‚â§200, Docs ‚â§500
- Modular Architecture: Single responsibility, split files approaching limits
- Safety-First: Branch-based development, never commit to main
- Handoff Documentation: Maintain HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md with honest status
- Community Wisdom: Log patterns and solutions for collective learning
- **Evidence-Based Development**: Test systems before claiming they work

UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY:
- AI Systems: Claude/OpenAI/Gemini/Future AI platforms
- User Types: Individual/Team/Organization/Educational
- Context Windows: Optimized for all major AI providers
- Skill Levels: Progressive complexity with clear entry points

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Repository: AI Development Standards
- Purpose: Universal AI development standards
- Your Role: [Individual Developer/Team Member/Organization/Student]
- AI System: [Claude/OpenAI/Gemini/Other]
- Current Compliance: [Check repository health automatically]
- Session Goal: [What you want to accomplish]

VALIDATION COMMANDS (remind me to run):
npm run log-collaboration          # MANDATORY FIRST ACTION
npm run validate-context && npm run validate && npm run pre-merge-validation

SUCCESS CRITERIA: 
- Session logged before any work begins
- Repository health maintained/improved
- All files respect context limits
- Modular architecture preserved
- Branch workflow followed
- Handoff updated with accurate status
- Community patterns documented
- **NEW**: Claims validated through actual testing

‚ö†Ô∏è ENHANCED HANDOFF PROTOCOL v2.1:
1. **MANDATORY FIRST**: Log current session (prevents total progress loss)
2. ALWAYS read HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md after session logging
3. Check GitHub Issues for health monitoring alerts
4. Verify current state matches user description
5. Proactively monitor for emerging issues during work
6. Update handoff with session progress and status
7. **NEW**: Document reality vs claims gaps and fixes

üß† COMMUNITY WISDOM INTEGRATION v2.1:
- Leverage existing patterns from community-patterns.json
- Document new patterns for collective benefit (4 patterns documented)
- Share solutions across user/AI combinations
- Contribute to universal knowledge base
- **NEW**: Include session logging and testing validation patterns

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID (Learned from Community):
- ‚ùå Starting work without session logging (total progress loss risk)
- ‚ùå Success claims without testing (reality vs claims gap)
- ‚ùå Interfaces without implementations (broken dependency illusion)
- ‚ùå Assumption-based development (evidence-based required)

Acknowledge requirements and confirm you've LOGGED THE SESSION FIRST, then read handoff and checked repository health.
```

### **Session Continuity Prompt v2.1**
```
# SESSION CONTINUITY: Universal AI Standards Handoff Protocol v2.1
# For ANY AI continuing work from previous sessions (Claude/OpenAI/Gemini/etc.)

üö® CRITICAL: Previous AI session may have been interrupted or incomplete

MANDATORY HANDOFF PROTOCOL v2.1:
1. **FIRST ACTION**: Log current session (npm run log-collaboration) - MANDATORY
2. READ github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards/blob/main/HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md
3. CHECK GitHub Issues for automated health alerts from Repository Health Monitor
4. VERIFY if status matches current user description
5. If mismatch (e.g., handoff says "resolved" but user reports ongoing issues):
   - Investigate what happened since last handoff update
   - Update handoff with current accurate state
   - Document the gap for community learning
6. PROACTIVELY check for new issues that may have emerged
7. Proceed with appropriate action based on TRUE current state

üö® SESSION LOGGING CRITICAL UPDATE:
- **Risk**: If context lost without session logging, ALL PROGRESS LOST
- **Prevention**: Session logging now MANDATORY before any work
- **Recovery**: Session logs enable recovery from any interruption
- **Evidence**: Session documentation provides proof of work completion

UNIVERSAL CONTEXT PROTECTION:
- All files follow size limits for universal AI compatibility
- Modular architecture prevents context overflow across all AI systems
- Handoff provides seamless session-to-session continuity
- Health monitoring prevents issues from accumulating
- **NEW**: Session logging prevents total progress loss

SELF-HEALING ACTIVATION v2.1:
If problems detected:
- Use AI-proactive investigation (don't wait for user guidance)
- Check community patterns for similar issues (4 patterns available)
- Implement comprehensive fixes using branch workflow
- Update monitoring systems to prevent recurrence
- **NEW**: Test all fixes through execution, not just claims

INCOMPLETE WORK PROTOCOL v2.1:
If previous session was interrupted:
- Check session logs for documented progress
- Document what was completed vs. what remains
- Update handoff with honest incomplete status
- Create clear next steps for continuation
- Ensure no broken state is left in repository
- Check if Repository Health Monitor has detected issues

EVIDENCE-BASED DEVELOPMENT (NEW REQUIREMENT):
- Test all systems by actually running them
- Document actual results, not theoretical claims
- Provide evidence of functionality through execution
- User-driven reality checks integrated into protocol

Continue with MANDATORY session logging first, then full handoff awareness, proactive health monitoring, and honest status documentation.
