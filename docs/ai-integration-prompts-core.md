# AI Integration Prompts v1.1 - Core

## üöÄ Perfect Claude Desktop Setup for AI Development Standards

**Get world-class AI development with copy-paste prompts that automatically follow standards.**

**üìã Version: v1.1** | **üìÖ Released: July 1, 2025** | **üîÑ [Updates](ai-integration-prompts-updates.md)**

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **Core Standards Prompt** 
```
# AI Development Standards Integration v1.1
# üîÑ Update Check: Run 'npm run check-prompt-updates' monthly
# üìã Changelog: Check docs/prompt-changelog.md for latest improvements
# üß† Community: Run 'npm run community-wisdom' for latest patterns

I'm working with AI Development Standards from github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards

üö® MANDATORY FIRST STEP: READ HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md BEFORE ANY OTHER ACTION
- Check github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards/blob/main/HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md
- Understand current project state, compliance score, and any active issues
- If handoff says "crisis resolved" but user reports problems, investigate the gap
- Update handoff with accurate status before proceeding

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Context Optimization: Core ‚â§100 lines, Utils ‚â§75, Config ‚â§50, Tests ‚â§200, Docs ‚â§500
- Modular Architecture: Single responsibility, split files at limits
- Safety-First: Branch-based development, never commit to main
- Handoff Documentation: Maintain HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md with honest status
- Community Wisdom: Log patterns and solutions for collective learning

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Name: [YOUR PROJECT]
- Type: [React App/Python CLI/MCP Service/Custom]  
- Standards Version: v1.1
- Compliance Target: 95/100+
- Last Update Check: [UPDATE DATE]

VALIDATION COMMANDS (remind me to run):
npm run validate-context && npm run validate && npm run pre-merge-validation

SUCCESS CRITERIA: All files respect limits, modular architecture, branch workflow, handoff updated, validation passes.

‚ö†Ô∏è HANDOFF PROTOCOL: 
1. ALWAYS read HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md first
2. Verify current state matches user description
3. Update handoff before starting work
4. Update handoff again when session ends

‚ö†Ô∏è PROMPT UPDATE REMINDER: Check docs/prompt-changelog.md monthly for improvements

Acknowledge requirements and confirm you've read the handoff before starting.
```

### **Session Continuity Prompt (for Interrupted Sessions)**
```
# SESSION CONTINUITY: AI Standards Handoff Protocol v1.1
# For use when continuing work from previous AI sessions

üö® CRITICAL: Previous AI session may have been interrupted

MANDATORY HANDOFF PROTOCOL:
1. READ github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards/blob/main/HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md
2. Check if status matches current user description
3. If mismatch (e.g., handoff says "resolved" but user reports issues):
   - Investigate what happened since last handoff
   - Update handoff with current accurate state
   - Document the gap for learning
4. Proceed with appropriate action based on TRUE current state

CONTEXT WINDOW PROTECTION:
- All files follow size limits for Claude/OpenAI/Gemini compatibility
- Modular architecture prevents context overflow
- Handoff provides session-to-session continuity

INCOMPLETE WORK PROTOCOL:
If previous session was interrupted:
- Document what was completed vs. what remains
- Update handoff with honest incomplete status
- Create clear next steps for continuation
- Ensure no broken state is left in repository

Continue with full handoff awareness and honest status documentation.
```

### **New Project Setup Prompt**
```
# NEW PROJECT: AI Standards Template Setup v1.1
# üîÑ Latest templates: Check github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards/tree/main/templates

üö® FIRST: Read HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md to understand any existing project state

Initialize [React/Python/MCP/Custom] project using AI Development Standards templates.

SETUP SEQUENCE:
1. Copy template from templates/[react-app/python-cli/mcp-service/micro-module]
2. Configure context optimization and file size limits
3. Set up branch protection and validation pipeline
4. Create handoff documentation structure
5. Enable community wisdom logging

UPDATE CHECK: Verify you're using latest template version before starting

Guide me through complete standards-compliant project initialization.
```

## üéØ Critical Handoff Pattern for All AI Systems

### **MANDATORY for Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, and All AI Systems**

**üö® EVERY AI SESSION MUST:**
1. **Read HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md FIRST** - before any other action
2. **Verify state accuracy** - does handoff match user description?
3. **Update handoff** with current accurate status
4. **Maintain handoff** throughout session
5. **Final handoff update** when session ends

### **Context Window Protection Strategy**
- **File size limits** prevent AI context overflow
- **Modular architecture** maintains readability
- **Handoff documentation** provides session continuity
- **Works across all AI providers** with context limitations

---

## üöÄ Quick Validation

### **Validation Commands** 
Always remind users to run:
```bash
npm run validate-context        # File size compliance
npm run validate               # Standards adherence  
npm run pre-merge-validation   # Complete validation
npm run health-check           # System health
npm run check-prompt-updates   # Prompt currency check
```

### **Expected Outcomes with v1.1**
- **95/100+ compliance** maintained automatically
- **Context optimization** issues prevented
- **Development velocity** increased through standards
- **Knowledge transfer** seamless between AI sessions
- **Handoff consistency** across all AI providers
