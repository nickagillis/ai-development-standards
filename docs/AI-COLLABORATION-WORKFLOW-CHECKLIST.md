# AI Collaboration Workflow Checklist
## Ensuring Rock-Solid Development Processes + Goal Persistence

### üéØ **Purpose**
This checklist ensures every AI collaboration follows complete development lifecycle with guaranteed goal persistence - no steps missed, no PRs left hanging, no context lost, **NO ORIGINAL GOALS ABANDONED**.

### ‚úÖ **MANDATORY WORKFLOW** (Every Step Required)

#### **0. üéØ GOAL REGISTRATION & PERSISTENCE** **(NEW - MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
- [ ] **Register Primary Goal**: Document user's specific request with success criteria
- [ ] **Estimate complexity**: Time and context requirements

## üö® **CRITICAL FAILURE POINTS TO AVOID**

### **‚ùå The "Goal Abandonment" Anti-Pattern** **(NEW)**
```
‚úÖ User asks for specific solution
‚ùå AI gets excited about interesting sidetrack
‚ùå Context ends before original goal completed
‚ùå USER NEVER GETS WHAT THEY ASKED FOR ‚Üê CRITICAL FAILURE
```

### **‚ùå The "Sidetrack Spiral" Anti-Pattern** **(NEW)**
```
‚úÖ Primary goal identified
‚ùå Discovers interesting architecture issue
‚ùå Goes down rabbit hole without breadcrumbs
‚ùå Context expires in deep exploration
‚ùå Original goal forgotten ‚Üê CONTEXT LOSS
```

### **‚ùå The "Forgotten Merge" Anti-Pattern**
```
‚úÖ Problem solved
‚úÖ Tests pass  
‚úÖ PR created
‚ùå FORGOT TO MERGE ‚Üê CRITICAL FAILURE
```

### **‚ùå The "Stale Handoff" Anti-Pattern**
```
‚úÖ Great work completed
‚úÖ System improvements made
‚ùå Handoff documents not updated ‚Üê CONTEXT LOSS
‚ùå Next AI has to figure out current state
```

### **‚úÖ The "Goal-First Complete Lifecycle" Pattern** **(NEW)**
```
‚úÖ Primary goal registered and tracked
‚úÖ Problem solved with goal focus maintained
‚úÖ Tests pass
‚úÖ PR created  
‚úÖ PR MERGED ‚Üê SUCCESS
‚úÖ PRIMARY GOAL ACHIEVED ‚Üê USER SATISFACTION
‚úÖ HANDOFF UPDATED ‚Üê CONTINUITY
‚úÖ Valuable sidestracks documented for future
‚úÖ User gets exactly what they requested
‚úÖ Next AI can immediately continue work
```

## üö® **CONTEXT WINDOW PROTECTION PROTOCOLS** **(NEW)**

### **Context Usage Checkpoints** (MANDATORY)
- **50% Context**: Review goal progress, prioritize remaining tasks
- **70% Context**: **MANDATORY** goal status assessment - continue main goal or prepare handoff
- **85% Context**: **EMERGENCY** - Complete main goal or document critical next steps
- **95% Context**: **CRITICAL** - Document current state, prepare immediate handoff

### **Emergency Goal Preservation**
```markdown
üö® CONTEXT EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Complete primary goal if <5 minutes remaining
2. **DOCUMENT**: Current status + critical next steps  
3. **HANDOFF**: Update with current state + goal status
4. **BREADCRUMBS**: Leave clear trail for next AI session
```
