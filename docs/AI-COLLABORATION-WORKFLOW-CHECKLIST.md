# AI Collaboration Workflow Checklist v3.0
## Violation Prevention Enhanced: Rock-Solid Development + Goal Persistence + Session Continuity

### üéØ **Purpose**
This checklist ensures every AI collaboration follows complete development lifecycle with **guaranteed violation prevention**, goal persistence, and seamless session continuity across AI providers - **no protocol violations, no steps missed, no PRs left hanging, no context lost, NO ORIGINAL GOALS ABANDONED**.

## üö® **MANDATORY VIOLATION PREVENTION PROTOCOL** (Enhanced v3.0)

### **-1. üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL: SESSION LOGGING FIRST** *(MANDATORY - VIOLATION PREVENTION)*
- [ ] **Log current session BEFORE any other action** - `npm run log-collaboration`
- [ ] **Document session goals and approach** before reading handoff
- [ ] **Create progress protection** against context interruption
- [ ] **NO EXCEPTIONS** - emergencies, email spam fixes, simple questions ALL require session logging first
- [ ] **ANTI-PATTERN PREVENTED**: Starting Work Without Session Logging (anti-pattern-004)

### **0. üö® MANDATORY HANDOFF READING** *(AFTER SESSION LOGGING)*
- [ ] **Read HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md COMPLETELY** after session logging completed
- [ ] **Read QUICK-HANDOFF-STATUS.md** for immediate status
- [ ] **VERIFY handoff accuracy** against user description
- [ ] **INVESTIGATE discrepancies** if handoff doesn't match reality
- [ ] **UPDATE handoff** with current accurate state if needed
- [ ] **CONFIRM system understanding** before proceeding
- [ ] **DOCUMENT AI provider** being used (Claude/OpenAI/Gemini)

### **0.1. üß™ USER QUALITY ASSURANCE INTEGRATION** *(NEW - CRITICAL)*
- [ ] **Welcome user quality assurance** throughout session
- [ ] **Expect user verification**: "Did you log session first?" "Following standards?"
- [ ] **Respond to corrections immediately** when violations detected
- [ ] **Thank users for catching violations** - improves AI reliability
- [ ] **Demonstrate compliance through behavior** with evidence
- [ ] **ANTI-PATTERN PREVENTED**: Standards Documentation Without Compliance (anti-pattern-005)

```markdown
## üß™ USER QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKPOINTS
- [ ] User questions about protocol compliance welcomed
- [ ] Evidence provided for all completion claims
- [ ] User verification encouraged: "Can you verify this works?"
- [ ] Violations acknowledged and corrected immediately
