# How to Use This Standards Repository

## 🎯 For Future AI Development Sessions

This repository serves as our shared knowledge base for building production-ready applications. Here's how to ensure I use these standards in every project:

### **🚀 Start Every Project With:**

**"Let's use our development standards from github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards"**

This signals me to:
1. ✅ Read the architecture requirements
2. ✅ Follow the pre-development checklist  
3. ✅ Use appropriate project templates
4. ✅ Apply safety-first development practices

### **📋 Standard Workflow**

#### **1. Project Initialization**
```
Human: "I need an AI tool for [business problem]. Let's use our development standards."

AI Response:
- Read github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards
- Review architecture requirements
- Follow pre-development checklist
- Choose appropriate template
- Begin development with standards
```

#### **2. During Development**
- Follow modular architecture patterns
- Implement safety-first practices
- Use configuration-driven development
- Maintain MCP-friendly structure
- Apply production-ready error handling

#### **3. Before Completion**
- Verify all architecture requirements met
- Complete code review checklist
- Ensure documentation is complete
- Validate production readiness

## 🛡️ Ensuring Standards Compliance

### **Reference Pattern**
Always start AI development sessions with:
> *"Use standards from github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards"*

### **Quality Gates**
Before any project is considered complete:
- [ ] Architecture requirements checklist ✅
- [ ] Safety-first development checklist ✅
- [ ] Template compliance verified ✅
- [ ] Documentation complete ✅

### **Template Usage**
Choose the right template:
- **API/Backend:** [Node.js API Template](./templates/node-api/)
- **Frontend:** [React App Template](./templates/react-app/) *(coming soon)*
- **Full-Stack:** [Full-Stack Template](./templates/full-stack/) *(coming soon)*

## 📚 Key Documents to Reference

### **Before Starting Any Project:**
1. **[Architecture Requirements](./architecture/requirements.md)** - Core standards
2. **[Pre-Development Checklist](./checklists/pre-development.md)** - Setup guide
3. **[Project Templates](./templates/)** - Starting points

### **During Development:**
1. **[Code Review Checklist](./checklists/code-review.md)** *(coming soon)*
2. **[Security Guidelines](./docs/security.md)** *(coming soon)*
3. **[Testing Standards](./docs/testing.md)** *(coming soon)*

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### **After Each Project:**
- Update standards based on lessons learned
- Add new templates for common patterns
- Enhance checklists with discovered best practices
- Document successful patterns for reuse

### **Repository Evolution:**
This repository grows with every project:
- ✅ New templates added
- ✅ Standards refined based on experience
- ✅ Best practices documented
- ✅ Examples and case studies added

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### **Quality Indicators:**
