# AI Integration Prompts - Fork Strategy

## üç¥ Organization Deployment Guide

### **For Organizations**
```
# ORGANIZATION: AI Standards Fork Setup v1.0
# üîÑ Upstream sync: Set up GitHub Action for automatic updates
# üìã Customization: Maintain org-specific requirements while receiving improvements

Our organization uses forked AI Development Standards at github.com/[ORG]/ai-development-standards

ORGANIZATION STANDARDS:
- Compliance Level: 99/100 (mandatory)
- Custom templates in templates/org/
- Additional security: [ORG-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]
- Validation: [ORG-SPECIFIC COMMANDS]
- Upstream sync: [WEEKLY/MONTHLY/QUARTERLY]

UPDATE POLICY: Review upstream improvements monthly, apply selectively with team approval

Follow organizational standards plus core AI Development Standards requirements.
```

### **Fork + Prompt Workflow**
1. **Organization forks** standards repository
2. **Customizes prompts** in documentation files
3. **Team members reference** organization's version
4. **Community improvements** flow back via PR to main repository
5. **Automated sync** keeps org fork current with upstream

## üîÑ Automated Sync Setup

### **GitHub Action Configuration**
Set up `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` in your fork:

```yaml
name: Sync with Upstream
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly check
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Sync upstream
      run: |
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards.git
        git fetch upstream
        # Custom merge logic here
```

### **Selective Integration**
- **Core standards**: Always sync
- **Templates**: Review for applicability
- **Documentation**: Merge with org customizations
- **Prompts**: Integrate while preserving org-specific content

```
ORGANIZATION-SPECIFIC ADDITIONS:
