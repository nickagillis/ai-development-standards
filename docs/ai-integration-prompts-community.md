# AI Integration Prompts - Community Learning

## ðŸ“Š Community Wisdom Integration

### **Pattern Recognition Prompt Addition**
```
# COMMUNITY WISDOM ENGINE INTEGRATION v1.0
# ðŸ§  Contribute: Help improve prompts for everyone through pattern sharing

During development, identify and log:

SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS:
- Architectural solutions that work well
- Performance improvements discovered  
- Effective debugging techniques
- Useful workarounds for common problems

CONTRIBUTION FORMAT:
```json
{
  "pattern": "solution-description",
  "context": "when-applicable",
  "outcome": "measurable-result", 
  "difficulty": "implementation-complexity",
  "standards_version": "v1.0"
}
```

AUTO-UPDATE BENEFIT: Your patterns help improve prompts for entire community

Suggest anonymized community contributions when valuable patterns emerge.
```

### **Anti-Pattern Detection**
```
# ANTI-PATTERN PREVENTION v1.0
# ðŸš¨ Proactive guidance based on community learning patterns

Watch for and help avoid:
- Files approaching size limits (warn at 80% of limit)
- Circular dependencies or tight coupling
- Direct main branch commits
- Missing error handling or validation
- Unclear module boundaries

COMMUNITY INSIGHT: These patterns identified from 100+ real project analyses

Provide proactive guidance to prevent these issues.
