# AI Integration Prompts v1.0

## üöÄ Perfect Claude Desktop Setup for AI Development Standards

**Get world-class AI development with copy-paste prompts that automatically follow standards and contribute to community learning.**

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **Core Standards Prompt** 
```
# AI Development Standards Integration v1.0
I'm working with AI Development Standards from github.com/nickagillis/ai-development-standards

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Context Optimization: Core ‚â§100 lines, Utils ‚â§75, Config ‚â§50, Tests ‚â§200, Docs ‚â§500
- Modular Architecture: Single responsibility, split files at limits
- Safety-First: Branch-based development, never commit to main
- Handoff Documentation: Maintain HANDOFF-SUMMARY.md with honest status
- Community Wisdom: Log patterns and solutions for collective learning

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Name: [YOUR PROJECT]
- Type: [React App/Python CLI/MCP Service/Custom]  
- Compliance Target: 95/100+

VALIDATION COMMANDS (remind me to run):
npm run validate-context && npm run validate && npm run pre-merge-validation

SUCCESS CRITERIA: All files respect limits, modular architecture, branch workflow, handoff updated, validation passes.

Acknowledge requirements and start development following these standards.
```

### **New Project Setup Prompt**
```
# NEW PROJECT: AI Standards Template Setup
Initialize [React/Python/MCP/Custom] project using AI Development Standards templates.

SETUP SEQUENCE:
1. Copy template from templates/[react-app/python-cli/mcp-service/micro-module]
2. Configure context optimization and file size limits
3. Set up branch protection and validation pipeline
4. Create handoff documentation structure
5. Enable community wisdom logging

Guide me through complete standards-compliant project initialization.
```

## üç¥ Fork Strategy Integration

### **For Organizations**
```
# ORGANIZATION: AI Standards Fork Setup  
Our organization uses forked AI Development Standards at github.com/[ORG]/ai-development-standards

ORGANIZATION STANDARDS:
- Compliance Level: 99/100 (mandatory)
- Custom templates in templates/org/
- Additional security: [ORG-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]
- Validation: [ORG-SPECIFIC COMMANDS]

Follow organizational standards plus core AI Development Standards requirements.
```

### **Fork + Prompt Workflow**
1. **Organization forks** standards repository
2. **Customizes prompts** in `docs/ai-integration-prompts.md`
3. **Team members reference** organization's version
4. **Community improvements** flow back via PR to main repository

---

## üìä Community Learning Integration

### **Pattern Recognition Prompt Addition**
```
# COMMUNITY WISDOM ENGINE INTEGRATION
During development, identify and log:

SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS:
- Architectural solutions that work well
- Performance improvements discovered  
- Effective debugging techniques
- Useful workarounds for common problems

CONTRIBUTION FORMAT:
```json
{
  "pattern": "solution-description",
  "context": "when-applicable",
  "outcome": "measurable-result", 
  "difficulty": "implementation-complexity"
}
```

Suggest anonymized community contributions when valuable patterns emerge.
```

### **Anti-Pattern Detection**
```
# ANTI-PATTERN PREVENTION
Watch for and help avoid:
- Files approaching size limits (warn at 80% of limit)
- Circular dependencies or tight coupling
- Direct main branch commits
- Missing error handling or validation
- Unclear module boundaries

Provide proactive guidance to prevent these issues.
```
