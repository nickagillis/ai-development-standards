## üîç Human Review Checklist for AI-Generated Code

Use this checklist when reviewing any AI-generated code before merging to production.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Compliance

### **Modular Design**
- [ ] **Single Responsibility** - Each file/function has one clear purpose
- [ ] **Module Size** - Files are manageable (‚â§300 lines typically)
- [ ] **Dependencies** - Clear, minimal dependencies between modules
- [ ] **Reusability** - Common functionality is properly abstracted

### **Separation of Concerns**
- [ ] **Data Layer** - Database/API access isolated in data/ directory
- [ ] **Business Logic** - Core logic separated in business/ directory  
- [ ] **Presentation** - UI/API endpoints in presentation/ directory
- [ ] **No Cross-Contamination** - Business logic not mixed with data access

### **Configuration Management**
- [ ] **Environment Variables** - All config uses environment variables
- [ ] **No Hardcoded Values** - No URLs, credentials, or settings in code
- [ ] **Config Validation** - Environment variables validated on startup
- [ ] **Documentation** - .env.example shows all required variables

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Review

### **Input Validation**
- [ ] **All Endpoints** - Every API endpoint validates input
- [ ] **Data Types** - Proper type checking for all parameters
- [ ] **Length Limits** - String length and array size limits enforced
- [ ] **Sanitization** - HTML/SQL injection protection implemented

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] **Authentication** - Proper user authentication implemented
- [ ] **Authorization** - Role-based access controls where needed
- [ ] **Session Management** - Secure session handling
- [ ] **Password Security** - Passwords properly hashed (bcrypt/scrypt)

### **Dependency Security**
- [ ] **Known Vulnerabilities** - No known security issues in dependencies
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies** - Only necessary packages included
- [ ] **Version Pinning** - Exact versions specified in package.json
- [ ] **Regular Updates** - Strategy for keeping dependencies current

### **Data Protection**
- [ ] **Secrets Management** - No credentials in code or logs
- [ ] **Data Encryption** - Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- [ ] **Error Messages** - No sensitive data leaked in error responses
- [ ] **Logging Security** - No passwords or tokens logged

---

## üîß Code Quality

### **Error Handling**
- [ ] **Try-Catch Blocks** - All external calls wrapped in error handling
- [ ] **Meaningful Messages** - Error messages provide useful context
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation** - App handles failures gracefully
- [ ] **Logging** - Errors properly logged for debugging

### **Performance**
- [ ] **Database Queries** - Efficient queries with proper indexing
- [ ] **Memory Usage** - No obvious memory leaks or excessive usage
- [ ] **API Response Times** - Reasonable response times for all endpoints
- [ ] **Caching Strategy** - Appropriate caching where beneficial

### **Testing**
- [ ] **Unit Tests** - Business logic has unit tests
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - API endpoints have integration tests
- [ ] **Edge Cases** - Error conditions and edge cases tested
- [ ] **Test Coverage** - Reasonable test coverage (‚â•80% for critical paths)

## üìö Documentation

### **Code Documentation**
- [ ] **README** - Clear project setup and usage instructions
- [ ] **API Docs** - All endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] **Code Comments** - Complex logic explained with comments

### **Deployment Documentation**
- [ ] **Deployment Guide** - Step-by-step deployment instructions
- [ ] **Environment Config** - Production environment configuration
- [ ] **Monitoring Setup** - Logging and monitoring configuration
- [ ] **Rollback Procedure** - Clear rollback instructions

---

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### **Monitoring & Logging**
- [ ] **Health Checks** - Health check endpoints implemented
- [ ] **Structured Logging** - Consistent, structured log format
- [ ] **Error Tracking** - Error monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] **Performance Metrics** - Key performance indicators tracked

### **Scalability**
- [ ] **Database Connections** - Connection pooling implemented
- [ ] **Stateless Design** - Application designed to be stateless
- [ ] **Resource Limits** - Appropriate memory and CPU limits
- [ ] **Load Testing** - Performance under load verified

### **Deployment**
- [ ] **Environment Parity** - Dev/staging/production consistency
- [ ] **Database Migrations** - Safe migration strategy implemented
- [ ] **Rollback Plan** - Tested rollback procedure available
- [ ] **Zero Downtime** - Deployment strategy minimizes downtime

## üö® Red Flags - Do Not Merge If:

- ‚ùå **Hardcoded credentials** or sensitive data in code
- ‚ùå **SQL injection** vulnerabilities present
- ‚ùå **No input validation** on user-facing endpoints
- ‚ùå **Missing error handling** around external calls
- ‚ùå **No tests** for critical business logic
- ‚ùå **Unclear or missing** deployment documentation
- ‚ùå **Known security vulnerabilities** in dependencies
- ‚ùå **Performance issues** that impact user experience
