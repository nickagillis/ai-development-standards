# Architecture Requirements

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Standards

Every AI-developed project must follow these fundamental requirements:

### **Modular Design with Single Responsibility**
- Each module/file has ONE clear purpose
- Functions are small and focused (≤50 lines typically)
- Classes have single, well-defined responsibilities
- Easy to understand, test, and modify independently

### **Clear Separation of Concerns**
```
data/           # Database access, API calls, file I/O
business/       # Core logic, calculations, validations  
presentation/   # UI components, API endpoints, formatting
```

### **Configuration-Driven Development**
- Environment variables for all settings
- Configuration files for complex settings
- No hardcoded values in business logic
- Easy to deploy across environments

### **MCP-Friendly File Structure**
- Descriptive file and folder names
- Logical organization that AI can navigate
- README files explaining complex modules
- Clear entry points and interfaces

### **Production-Ready Error Handling**
- Try-catch blocks around all external calls
- Meaningful error messages with context
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation when possible

## 🛡️ Safety-First Development

### **Branch-Based Development**
- **NEVER** commit directly to main branch
- Create feature branches for all changes
- Use pull requests with required reviews
- Automated testing before merge

### **Security Validation**
- Validate ALL external dependencies
- Input sanitization and validation by default
- Environment variable protection
- No secrets in code or logs

### **Documentation & Testing**
- README for every module
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for critical paths

## 🎯 Quality Gates

Before any code is considered complete:

### **✅ Architecture Checklist**
- [ ] Follows modular design principles
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Configuration-driven settings
- [ ] MCP-friendly structure
- [ ] Production error handling

### **✅ Safety Checklist**  
- [ ] Developed in feature branch
- [ ] All dependencies validated
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Tests written and passing

### **✅ Production Readiness**
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Logging implemented appropriately
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security review completed

## 🚀 Scalability Considerations

### **For Small Projects (MVP/Demo)**
- Focus on modularity and clarity
- Basic error handling and validation
- Simple configuration management

### **For Medium Projects (Production)**
- Add comprehensive testing
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Database optimization
- API rate limiting and caching

### **For Large Projects (Enterprise)**
- Microservices architecture
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Load balancing and scaling
- Compliance and audit requirements
